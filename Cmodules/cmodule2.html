                    <h2 class="hdteam">Instructions in C</h2>
                    <p>A Program is just a set of Instructions. Specific Instruction help  us to achieve Specific type of task in a Program. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Types of Instructions</b> <br><br>
                        There are three types of Instructions in C, as follows <br>
                        a) Type Declaration Instruction : <br>
                        This Instruction is used to declare the type of variable used in C Program. <br> <br>
                        b) Arithmetic Instruction : <br>
                        This Instruction is used to perform arithmetic operation on constant or variable. <br><br>
                        c) Control Instruction : <br>
                        This Instruction is used to Control the sequence of execution of various statements in a c Program. <br><br>
                        <b>Type Declaration Instruction</b> <br><br>
                        The type declaration statement is written at the beginning of <b>main()</b> function. <br>
                        Example, <br>
                        int bas; <br>
                        float grossal; <br>
                        char name; <br>
                        We can also initialise the variable while declaring, as follows <br>
                        int num = 5, i = 10; <br>
                        float avg = 10.5, j = 3.5 <br>
                        
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Arithmetic Instruction</b> <br><br>
                        An arithmetic statement consist variable name on left hand side of '=' and they connected with operator on right hand side of '='. For Example, <br>
                        int i, a = 2; <br>
                        i = a + 5; <br><br>
                        Arithmetic statement in C could be of three types, as <br>
                        1) Integer mode : In this statement, all operands are either integer variables or integer constants. <br>
                        2) Real mode : In this statement, all operands are either real variables or real constants. <br>
                        3) Mixed mode : In this statement, some operands are integer and some are real. <br> <br>
                        Arithmetic operations can be performed on int, float and char. So following statements are valid. <br>
                        char x = 'a', y = 'b'; <br>
                        int z = x + y; <br> <br>
                        <b>Integer and Float Conversions</b> <br><br>
                        As to do Programming in C effectively you have to understand the rules used for implicit conversion of floating point and integer values. These are mentioned below <br><br>
                        a) An arithmetic operation between an integer and integer always yields an integer result. Same as for operation between two real yields real result. <br> <br>
                        b) An operation between an integer and real always yields a real result. In this operation, the integer is first promoted to a real and then the operation is performed. Hence the result is real. <br> <br>  
                        Let's have a look on it. <br>
                    </p>
                    <table border="">
                        <tr>
                            <th>Operation</th>
                            <th>Result</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>

                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>5.0/2</td>
                            <td>2.5</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>5/2.0</td>
                            <td>2.5</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>5.0/2.0</td>
                            <td>2.5</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>
                        <b>Type conversion in Assigments</b> <br><br>
                        If the type of expression on RHS and LHS of '=' are not same then the value of the expression on RHS is promoted or demoted depending on the type of variable on LHS of '='. For Example consider the following statements. <br>
                        int i; <br>
                        i = 3.5; <br>
                        Here, though 3.5 is a <strong>float</strong>, it cannot be stored in  i since it is an <strong>int</strong>. Hence 3.5 is demoted to 3 and then stored in i. <br><br>

                        <b>Associativity of Operators</b> <br><br>
                        When an expression two operators of equal priority, the tie between them is settled using the associativity of the operator. <br>
                        All operator in C either have left to right associativity or right to left associativity. For Example, <br>
                        a = 3/2*5; <br>
                        Here there is a tie between operators of same priority, that is between / and *. Both enjoy left to right associativity. Therefore firstly / operation is done following by *. <br><br><br>
                        <b>Control Instructions</b> <br><br> 
                        Control Instructions control the order in which the instructions in a program get executed. In other words, the control instructions determine the <strong>Flow of Control</strong> in a Program. <br>
                        We will learn about it in further modules. <br>
